          <strong>Har Ghar Khushiyan</strong> is a dedicated non-governmental organization (NGO) driven by a simple yet powerful mission: to bring joy, dignity, and hope to every home. Rooted in compassion and social responsibility, we work tirelessly to uplift underprivileged communities by providing essential support such as nutritious food, clean clothing, shelter, and other life necessities to those in need.
          Established with the belief that no one should be deprived of basic human rights and dignity, Samajik Har Ghar Khushiyan has touched countless lives through its on-ground efforts and people-first approach. Our aim is not just to offer temporary relief but to build a compassionate ecosystem where every individual, regardless of their socio-economic status, can live with security, respect, and happiness.
         </p>

          We believe in the power of community and collective effort. Through our various initiatives, we strive to create a better world for everyone.
